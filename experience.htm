			  This courses helped my son find something he really enjoys besides just playing a game. Now he is looking forward to learning more about programming.

			  My 12 year old son loves it! He's learning a skill while having fun. The teaching videos are entertaining and a perfect way for kids to learn.

              I am really thankful that you work with kids and teach in a way that is understandable. Very few people make such an effort to help students achieve their goals the way you do.
